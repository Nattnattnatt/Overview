\section{Introduction}
This is just for me, so that I know what I already did so far. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Example of persistency criterion for moving one node.
    \item Generalised persistency criteria extended to quadratic cost function $\rightarrow$ Application: 3-node application.
    \item Generalise it even more to multi-linear cost function defined on the hypergraph. Also have some applications. 
\end{itemize}
